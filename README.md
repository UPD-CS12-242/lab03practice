# CS 12 24.2 Lab Exercise 3 Practice

Without modifying `model.py` and/or `project_types.py`, create a text-based _synchronous I/O_ view (`view.py`) and a corresponding controller (`controller.py`) that allows playing of the game _Subtract-a-Square_.

Additionally, create a `main.py` that instantiates the model, view, and controller and starts the game.

## Game mechanics

Instead of searching online on how the game works, you are strongly encouraged to instead infer the rules of the game and how it is played by checking the unit tests in `test_model.py` and cross-checking the logic in `model.py`.

## Input parsing

For this exercise, you may place input parsing logic in the controller.
